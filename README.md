# custom-unstage-revert README

This extension allows to set up regexps to easily unstage/revert pieces of code. (WIP - Beta)

## Features

When setting up regexps, ensure that they don't match multiple lines, just single lines or characters in a single line. **This extension is still in beta**, so it may malfunction or work weird, so **use it under your own responsibility**.

## Extension Settings

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `custom-unstage-revert.regexps`: List of regexps to evaluate and use when reverting / unstaging.

## Known Issues

It seems to work weird sometimes, be careful.

## Release Notes

Currently in Beta:

### 0.0.1

Initial release of custom unstage/revert. (Beta)
